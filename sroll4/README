* External library: "fftw"
  Now the "fftw-3.3.4.tgz" is directly include in the cvs source tree.
  Makefile is able to handle its decompression (and compilation) when required.

* Now the 'sroll' code automatically balance rings to be processed on available
  ranks. Therefore in the parameter file one shall only specify: 
    BeginRing = 240
    EndRing   = 27005

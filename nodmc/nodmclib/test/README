TEST directory (for developpers of the lib)

  This directory contains test files used by developpers of the "no dmc lib".

  If you want some examples of usage for the library please refer to the
  "examples/" directory instead.

PREREQUISITE

  In this document we will use the folowing conventions:
  ${LIB_DIR}:   is the directory where the shared library file "libno_dmc.so" is
                available.
                ex: $(pwd)/../Linux-x86_64
  ${PYLIB_DIR}: is the directory where the python wrapper shared library file
                "nodmclib.so" is available.
                ex: $(pwd)/../Linux-x86_64

WHAT IS TESTED

  Mainly the test directory is compose of 2 distinct test suites:

  1) Unitary and functionnal test:
     This type of test are check by the program "test_no_dmc_lib.c".
     Compil prog:
       $> make test
     To run it (see requirement from "doc/README" section 2.c for detail):
       $> cd Linux-x86_64/
       $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIB_DIR}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       $> ./test_libno_dmc

  2) Comparision test (between former legacy DMC lib and NO_DMC_LIB):
     This type of test are check by the Python script "compare_dmc.py"
     To run this script:
       $> export PYTHONPATH=${PYLIB_DIR}:$PYTHONPATH
       $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIB_DIR}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
       $> python compare_dmc.py
       Note: All output log should be "SUCCESS" ;)

  Please note that several parameters are manageable directly from the
  corresponding test source file.

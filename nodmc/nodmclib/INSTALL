INSTALL

  This document describe the ways to install the "no dmc lib" on your system.

  For short if you have download the release file named like "no_dmc-1.0.tgz"
  uncompress and untar it, then go to the created directory "no_dmc-1.0/" and
  type the commands: "make", "make install"
  This will compile then install the library and the related stuff as the
  python wrapper and the no_dmc_metadata.py tool.
  Note that you may have root privilege to install the lib in standard
  directories.
  If you want to work from CVS sources directly make sure to download a tagged
  version (ex: v01-00-04) then proceed as for the release file.
  CVS repository is available at:
  http://cvs.planck.fr/cvs/Level2/Lib_pkg/NO_DMC_LIB

  * REQUIREMENTS

    - GNU Make 3.80 (or superior)
    - gcc (GCC) 4.3.3 (or superior)

    ** For the python wrapper (cf. 'pylib' rule)
       - python 2.7.5 or 2.7.9 with modules:
         . numpy 1.7.0 (or superior)
         . Cython version 0.22

  * INSTALLATION NAMES

    By default, "make install" installs the package's commands under
    "/usr/bin", include files under "/usr/include" and lib files
    under "/usr/lib64".

    If you use an unusual directory layout you can give
    options like "BINDIR=DIR" to specify different values for particular
    kinds of files.
    List of the directories you can set and what kinds of files go in them:
    BINDIR (default=/usr/bin): for binary files
    INCLUDEDIR (default=/usr/include): for header files
    LIBDIR (default=/usr/lib64): for library files

    Note that by default the install process will automatically select the
    appropriate subdirectory of the current python version to install the
    python wrapper module (this is managed by python 'Distutils' tool).
    Typically if your python path is like "/softs/python/2.7.X/" then module
    will be installed in "/softs/python/2.7.X/lib/python2.7/site-packages/".

  * STAGED INSTALLS

    One shall want to install in a specified directory, for this purpose use the
    DESTDIR variable as follow:

    $> make DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install

    So that instead of installing files in /usr/bin/, /usr/lib64/, /usr/include/
    it will install in /tmp/stage/usr/bin/, /tmp/stage/usr/lib64/ and
    /tmp/stage/usr/include/
    Note also that in this case the python wrapper module will be installed in
    a specifif path /tmp/stage/python/site-packages/

    Additionaly, if one wants to install in DESTDIR without prefix '/usr':
    $> make PREFIX="" DESTDIR=/tmp/stage install

  * LDCONFIG

    If you have root privilege and want to avoid your users to use
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that they can load the installed library, please consider
    to launch the command 'ldconfig' with appropriate parameters just after
    'make install'.
    Assuming default install path, the following command should do the trick:
    $> ldconfig -n /usr/lib64

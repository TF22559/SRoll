EXAMPLES

  For all commands below we consider that you are in "examples/" directory after
  installation.
  If you don't have install but just extract the release file
  (ex: no_dmc-1.0.tgz), you will have to manualy update the Makefile!
  (see comments in file).


* "example_libno_dmc.c"

  This file present some simple usage of the C library NO_DMC_LIB.

  ** Compilation

  $> make examples
  Will compile and place the executable file "example_libno_dmc" inplace.

  ** Execution

  $> ./example_libno_dmc

  Note for you own program using NO_DMC_LIB:
  If NO_DMC_LIB is not installed in default directory you may have to
  update your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:
  $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIB_DIR}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  Where ${LIB_DIR} match the directory in which the library has been installed.

  ** Expected output

  Expected result in case of success:

    ALL SUCCESS !


* "example_no_dmc_python.py"

  This file present some simple usage of the python wrapper of NO_DMC_LIB.

  ** Requirements

  The requirements for using the python wrapper are mainly:

    - python 2.7.5 or 2.7.9 with modules:
      . numpy 1.7.0 (or superior)
      . Cython version 0.22

  ** Execution

  $> python example_no_dmc_python.py

  Depending on the NO_DMC_LIB installation, you may have to update your
  environment variables as follow:
  $> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=${LIB_DIR}:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  $> export PYTHONPATH=${PY_LIB_DIR}:$PYTHONPATH
  Where ${LIB_DIR} match the directory in which the library has been installed.
  Where ${PY_LIB_DIR} match the directory in which the python wrapper module
  has been installed.

  ** Expected output

  Expected result in case of success:

    ALL SUCCESS !
